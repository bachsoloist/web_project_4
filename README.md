BEM file structure was implemented to organize CSS files. The idea behind it is to divide the user interface into independent blocks. This makes interface development easy and fast even with a complex UI, and it allows reuse of existing code without copying and pasting. This allows for the files to always be in a familiar location, whioch makes it easier for developers to navigate a project and switch between projects.

Technologies used: HTML, CSS.
